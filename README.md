# NomicGPT — Nomic Discord Bot

A Discord bot built with TypeScript for playing Nomic: responds to @mentions, cites rules inline with links to your GitHub `rules.md`, and maintains rich conversation context through reply chains.

## Features

- **@mention Q&A**: Ask questions by mentioning the bot in any channel
- **Smart Reply Context**: Maintains conversation history including both user and bot messages (up to 6 user messages)
- **Live Rules & Scores Sync**: Fetches the latest `rules.md` and `scores.md` from GitHub
- **Inline Citations**: Converts references like `Rule 123` to markdown links to that rule anchor
- **Message Splitting**: Automatically splits long responses into multiple messages (Discord 2000 char limit)
- **TypeScript + Discord.js v14**

## Key Features Explained

### Smart Context Management
- **Reply Chain Traversal**: When you reply to the bot, it walks up the reply chain to gather context
- **Bidirectional History**: Includes both your messages and the bot's previous responses
- **Minimum User Messages**: Ensures at least 6 user messages are included for rich context
- **Mention Priority**: If you both mention and reply to the bot, reply context takes priority

### Message Handling
- **Automatic Splitting**: Long responses are split at natural boundaries (paragraphs, sentences)
- **Discord Compliant**: All messages stay under the 2000 character limit
- **Seamless Flow**: Multiple message chunks appear as a natural conversation

### Rule Integration
- **Live Sync**: Always uses the latest rules and scores from your GitHub repository
- **Smart Citations**: Automatically converts rule references to clickable links
- **Context Awareness**: Understands rule relationships and interactions
